# jpg2movie

## I use this to take my pictures and turn them into movies.  All you need to do is:
### assuming you have node and nvm installed...


### from the command line:
* git clone https://github.com/martytheparty/jpg2movie.git
* npm install
* nvm use
* node all

### then all of the pictures in raw_photos will be made into a movie.

#### I am assuming that no one will actually try this... if you do and it doesn't
let me know.
